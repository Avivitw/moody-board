        One of the most thoroughly modern interior design styles to consider,
        people often tend to confuse minimalism with a stark coldness and
        uncomfortable severity – which is hardly the case at all. In fact,
        there’s even a warmer take on minimal interior design (warm minimalism)
        that’s full of no-fuss, clean elegance. Think simplicity, refinement,
        and a deft hand at sumptuous comfort and functionality. The key here is
        to keep rooms spare and well-edited with printless fabrications and
        décor extras that must serve a dual purpose. When thinking minimal
        interior design styles trends, think of a modern art gallery or museum
        as a reference with their pulled together approach to filling a space
        with the barest of essentials that still feature a lively sense of drama
        either organic or abstract.
